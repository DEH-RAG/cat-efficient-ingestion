"""Dependency-metadata alignment with upstream CAT (plan Todo 6).

Upstream CAT resolves plugin-to-plugin dependencies from ``plugin.json``
``dependencies`` — exact folder-id strings matched against the plugin folders
(``Plugin.missing_dependencies``) — and installs pip dependencies from
``pyproject.toml`` ``[project].dependencies`` via uv (``requirements.txt`` is
not supported). This test pins both sides of that contract for EffING:

- the declared dependency string is the real folder id of the multimodal
  plugin (``cat_multimodal_ingestion``): the hyphenated repo name
  (``cat-multimodal-ingestion``) is NOT a folder id and would be reported
  missing, silently preventing the plugin from loading;
- the plugin loads on CAT with the dependency resolved, and a genuinely
  missing dependency is reported loudly (never silently skipped).

Runs against upstream CAT: the plugin folder is resolved via ``cat.utils``
when the file is copied into the host's ``tests/`` (the EffING-vs-CAT
harness), or by walking up to the folder holding ``plugin.json`` when run
from the plugin repo itself.
